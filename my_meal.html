                    <h3>WHY I LIKE JOLLOF RICE</h3>
                <p>I like JOllof Rice Because of the following reasons:</p>

                    <li>
                    <P>
Although all foods give you energy in the form of calories, not all foods affect your energy levels the same way. Carbohydrates are a faster energy source compared to proteins and fats because they are your body's preferred source of energy. Jollof rice is loaded with carbohydrates, which makes it good for providing energy to the body. Both tomatoes, rice, and the other spices used in preparing this meal are all great sources of healthy carbohydrates.

                        <p>
                            Some people may have health conditions that make many foods difficult for them to digest. People with digestive problems, nausea, or heartburn need to eat easy-to-digest foods that can satisfy their nutritional needs.

                            Not all grains are easy to digest, but white rice, which is commonly used in preparing jollof rice, is easy to digest. White rice is bland and low in fiber, which makes it easy to digest.

                        <P>
                            Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet peppers in a food processor or blender for about 45 seconds, make sure that everything is blended well.
                        </P>
                    </li>
                   <li>
                    <p>
                        In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. Once the oil is heated add the onions you set aside and fry just until they turn golden brown. Once the onions, have turned brown in color add the tomato paste and fry for 2-3 minutes. Then add the blended tomato mixture (reserve about 1/4 cup and set aside) and fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste for about 30 minutes. Make sure you stir consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn. gd

                        <p>
                            After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock. Mix and add your seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme, all purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube). Continue to boil for 10 minutes.
                        </p>

                            Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew. At this point if you need to add water so that the rice is level with the tomato mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so. Add the bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes.
